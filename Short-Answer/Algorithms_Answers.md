#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The main while loop seems to set an upper bound of n^3, which implies a possible runtime of O(n^3), however each iteration steps through growing at a rate of n^2. This ends up reducing the amount of actual iterations being run so the runtime complexity ends up being linear at **O(n)**.

b)

c)
